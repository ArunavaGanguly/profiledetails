    Photography is about art and I feel every picture has a particular story to tell.
    Every picture that I take has a different meaningful story behind it which makes
    the journey refreshing. Street photography to me challenges me to go beyond my
    comfort zone and live the experience of every images that I take. That is why Street
    photography is my favorite to shoot. And also the fact that there is a limitless
    boundary for composition and to frame a certain shot on the photo is beyond extraordinary.
    I also love to take portraitures as well. Maybe because you seem to find a different story
    in every charecters eye.
